## What is Snipe-IT?

**_Snipe-IT_** was made for asset management, to enable departments to track who has which asset, when it was purchased, which software licenses and accessories are available, and so on.

Snipe-IT is a Free Open Source (FOSS) web based project built on Laravel and it follows a standard Laravel MVC file structure.

This project is actively developed and they release quite frequently. Check out the Snipe-IT website for a demo, a comprehensive list of features, screenshots and announcements for updates on new versions.
